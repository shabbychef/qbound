Both result from scale-mixing of the normal distribution. The analogous matrix variate distributions and their characteristic functions are derived in the sequel and are dual to each other in the sense of a simple Duality Theorem. This theorem can thus be used to yield the derivation of the characteristic function of the t-distribution and is the essence of the idea used by Dreier and Kotz [A note on the characteristic function of the t -distribution, Statist. Probab. Lett. 57 (2002) 221–224].

	abstract={We describe the pension plan features of the states and the largest cities and counties in the U.S. Unlike in the private sector, defined benefit (DB) pensions are still the norm in the public sector. However, a few jurisdictions have shifted towards defined contribution (DC) plans as their primary savings plan, and fiscal pressures are likely to generate more movement in this direction. Holding fixed a public employee's work and salary history, we show that DB retirement income replacement ratios vary greatly across jurisdictions. This creates large variation in workers' need to save for retirement in other accounts. There is also substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions in the savings generated in primary DC plans because of differences in the level of mandatory employer and employee contributions. One notable difference between public and private sector DC plans is that public sector primary DC plans are characterized by required employee or employer contributions (or both), whereas private sector plans largely feature voluntary employee contributions that are supplemented by an employer match. We conclude by applying lessons from savings behavior in private sector savings plans to the design of public sector plans.},

	abstract={\&quot;A sector model presented in this article, uses about 200 representative French cereal-oriented farms to estimate policy impacts by means of mathematical modeling. Usually, such models suppose that farmers intend to maximize expected gross margin. This rationality hypothesis however seems hardly justifiable, especially these days, when gross margin variability due to European Common Agricultural Policy changes may become significant. Increasing uncertainty introduces bounded rationality to the decision problem so that crop gross margins may be better approximated by interval rather than by expected (precise) values. The initial LP problem is specified as an â¿¿Interval Linear Programming (ILP)â¿. We assume that farmers tend to decide upon their surface allocation prudently in order to get through with minimum loss, which is precisely the rationale underlying the minimization of maximum regret decision criterion. Recent advances in operations research, namely Mausser and Laguna algorithms, are exploited to implement the min-max regret criterion to arable agriculture ILP. The validation against observed crop mix proved that as uncertainty increases about 40\% of the farmers adopt the min-max regret decision rule instead of the gross margin maximization.\&quot;},

Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

abstract = { We revisit the well-known Behrens–Fisher problem and apply a newly developed ‘Computational Approach Test’ (CAT) to test the equality of two population means where the populations are assumed to be normal with unknown and possibly unequal variances. An advantage of the CAT is that it does not require the explicit knowledge of the sampling distribution of the test statistic. The CAT is then compared with three widely accepted tests—Welch–Satterthwaite test (WST), Cochran–Cox test (CCT), ‘Generalized p-value’ test (GPT)—and a recently suggested test based on the jackknife procedure, called Singh–Saxena–Srivastava test (SSST). Further, model robustness of these five tests are studied when the data actually came from t-distributions, but wrongly perceived as normal ones. Our detailed study based on a comprehensive simulation indicate some interesting results including the facts that the GPT is quite conservative, and the SSST is not as good as it has been claimed in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the trends observed in our study have not been reported earlier in the existing literature. }

For single comparisons, a Sharpe z statistic is well behaved and for multiple comparisons a Sharpe chi-square statistic is reasonably well behaved. The powers of the tests are quite sensitive to the population coefficients of variation. Multivariate test statistics based upon the Treynor measure were not very satisfactory.},

	abstract = {{Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27 of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.}},

The intuitive estimator constructed as if there were no prior selection appears to be misleading. This is especially so when one is estimating the characteristic of the chosen population, selected to maximise estimates of the similar characteristics. In such a case, the intuitive estimator highly overestimate the chosen characteristic. The characteristic focussed here is the mean and a normal parametric assumption of the observations is made. The problem of improving upon the intuitive estimators appears to be technically very difficult. No alternative estimator has been proposed which was shown to dominate the intuitive estimator in any sense. We provide an empirical Bayes estimator which was shown to dominate the intuitive estimator in terms of Bayes risk with respect to any normal prior. Note that the frequentist risk domination is not possible. Numerical studies also provide strong evidence that the domination is robust with respect to independently identically distributed priors, not necessarily normal. the estimator does not overestimate the target parameter for many circumstances.\&quot;},

Assuming that the portfolio asset returns are independent and multivariate normally distributed, we derive tests and confidence sets for all possible arrangements of these characteristics. Note that all of our results are based on the exact distributions for a finite sample size. Moreover, we determine a confidence region of the whole efficient frontier in the mean-variance space. It is shown that this set is bordered by five parabolas. }

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.

		Classical least squares (CLS) and partial least squares (PLS) are two common multivariate regression algorithms in chemometrics. This paper presents an asymptotically exact mathematical analysis of the mean squared error of prediction of CLS and PLS under the linear mixture model commonly assumed in spectroscopy. For CLS regression with a very large calibration set the root mean squared error is approximately equal to the noise per wavelength divided by the length of the net analyte signal vector. It is shown, however, that for a finite training set with n samples in p dimensions there are additional error terms that depend on sigma2p2/n2, where sigmais the noise level per co-ordinate. Therefore in the 'large p, small n' regime, common in spectroscopy, these terms can be quite large and even dominate the overall prediction error. It is demonstrated both theoretically and by simulations that dimensional reduction of the input data via their compact representation with a few features, selected for example by adaptive wavelet compression, can substantially decrease these effects and recover the asymptotic error. This analysis provides a theoretical justification for the need to perform feature selection (dimensional reduction) of the input data prior to application of multivariate regression algorithms.

Conversely, large share issues, high β, and highly volatile returns are associated with negative RMW and CMA exposures (like those of relatively unprofitable firms that invest aggressively) that help explain low average returns.},

 abstract = {We consider a testing problem in which a normal mean vector is at the origin under the null hypothesis and in a cone under the alternative and the covariance matrix is unknown. Perlman studied the likelihood ratio (LR) test and found that it is biased and hence does not compare favorably with Hotelling's T<sup>2</sup>. We point out that certain tests of Perlman are uniformly more powerful as well as simpler than the LR test. These are the corresponding LR tests when the alternative is replaced with a half space that contains the cone. We prove that these tests are unbiased by developing some basic results on stochastic ordering. Critical values for these tests are given. Simulation results suggest that the new tests are also uniformly more powerful than Hotelling's T<sup>2</sup>. For the special case when the cone is the positive orthant, we discuss an issue about invariant test. Finally, we discuss the assumption of unknown covariance matrix, and conclude that the new tests are more useful for small samples than for large samples.},

	abstract = {A score-type statistic, T<sub>s</sub>, is introduced for testing H: ψ = 0 against K: ψ ≥ 0 and more general one-sided hypotheses when nuisance parameters may be present; ψ is a vector parameter. The main advantages of T<sub>s</sub> are that it requires estimation of the model only under the null hypothesis and that, it is asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio statistic; these are precisely the reasons for the popularity of the score tests for testing against two-sided alternatives. In this sense, T<sub>s</sub> preserves the main attractive features of the classical two-sided score test. The theoretical results are presented in a general framework where the likelihood-based score function is replaced by an estimating function so that the test is applicable even if the exact population distribution is unknown. Computation of T<sub>s</sub> is simplified by the fact that it can be computed easily once the corresponding two-sided statistic has been computed. The relevance and simplicity of T<sub>s</sub> are illustrated by discussing a data example in detail. This example involves an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model, and the objective is to test for the presence of ARCH effect. The null and alternative hypotheses turn out to be of the form H: ψ = 0 and K: ψ ≥ 0 respectively where ψ is the vector of ARCH parameters. In contrast to the likelihood ratio and other equivalent forms that are currently available for testing against such one-sided hypotheses, we note the following: T<sub>s</sub> is convenient to apply, because the full ARCH model need not be estimated subject to the inequality constraint ψ ≥ 0 and we do not need to know the exact likelihood because T<sub>s</sub> is based on estimating equations rather than likelihoods.},

As in Perlman's test, the weights of the chi-bar square which determine the survival function of the one-sided Hotelling statistic depend on the unknown covariance parameter. Also as in Perlman, the maximal value of the weights over all possible covariance matrices is taken to get a p-value, so the test can be very conservative. This has consequences for use in finance, since it implies some disconnect between the sample statistic and the underlying population parameters (and that disconnect changes character as the sample size increases). silvapulle_hotelling.pdf"

Sharpe's measure is still a frequently recommended tool for measuring portfolio performance. The measure is, however, biased. It is the purpose of this note to demonstrate the existence of the bias, indicate its size, and provide a means of correcting it. }

  abstract={Focusing on capital asset returns governed by a factor structure, the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is a one-period model, in which preclusion of arbitrage over static portfolios of these assets leads to a linear relation between the expected return and its covariance with the factors. The APT, however, does not preclude arbitrage over dynamic portfolios. Consequently, applying the model to evaluate managed portfolios is contradictory to the no-arbitrage spirit of the model. An empirical test of the APT entails a procedure to identify features of the underlying factor structure rather than merely a collection of mean-variance efficient factor portfolios that satisfies the linear relation.},

We derive analytical results for the approximate bias and variance of the sample Sharpe ratio in terms of the underlying distribution parameters. The results clarify several misinterpretations existing in the literature. A Monte Carlo study shows that our bias and variance formulae approximate the true moments of the sample Sharpe ratio remarkably well. We propose using the analytical results to design an estimation risk-adjusted Sharpe ratio. An empirical study of mutual fund performance shows that using the adjusted Sharpe ratio gives a quite different performance ranking of those traditionally top-ranked funds.},

  abstract = {The leading term in the normal approximation to the distribution of Student's
t statistic is derived in a general setting, with the sole assumption being
that the sampled distribution is in the domain of attraction of a normal law.
The form of the leading term is shown to have its origin in the way in which
extreme data influence properties of the Studentized sum. The leading-term
approximation is used to give the exact rate of convergence in the central
limit theorem up to order n^{-1/2}, where n denotes sample size. It is proved
that the exact rate uniformly on the whole real line is identical to the exact
rate on sets of just three points. Moreover, the exact rate is identical to
that for the non-Studentized sum when the latter is normalized for scale using
a truncated form of variance, but when the corresponding truncated centering
constant is omitted. Examples of characterizations of convergence rates are
also given. It is shown that, in some instances, their validity uniformly on
the whole real line is equivalent to their validity on just two symmetric
points.},

A modification of the t variable is obtained that is useful for distributions with skewness as severe as that of the exponential distribution. The procedure is generalized and applied to the jackknife t variable for a class of statistics with moments similar to those of the sample mean. Tests of the correlation coefficient obtained using this procedure are compared empirically with corresponding tests determined using Fisher's z transformation and the usual jackknife estimate.},

  abstract={ In finite population sampling, it has long been known that, for small sample sizes, when sampling from a skewed population, the usual frequentist intervals for the population mean cover the true value less often than their stated frequency of coverage. Recently, a non-informative Bayesian approach to some problems in finite population sampling has been developed, which is based on the 'Polya posterior'. For large sample sizes, these methods often closely mimic standard frequentist methods. In this paper, a modification of the 'Polya posterior', which employs the weighted Polya distribution, is shown to give interval estimators with improved coverage properties for problems with skewed populations and small sample sizes. This approach also yields improved tests for hypotheses about the mean of a skewed distribution.},

	abstract = {A confidence interval and test are obtained for the mean of an asymmetric distribution using a random sample of size n. The method is based on N. J. Johnson{\textquoteright}s (1978) modified t-test, where terms of Cornish-Fisher expansions involving the third moment are used to adjust the conventional statistic to have more closely a Student{\textquoteright}s t-distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom. Johnson{\textquoteright}s (1978) test cannot be inverted uniquely, so a corresponding confidence interval for the mean may be disjointed. However, an artificial term of small order can be added to make inversion of the test a uniquely defined operation, which prevents such disjointedness. The resulting one-sided and two-sided intervals perform better than others in the literature with skewed distributions, and have good performance with a normal distribution. The two-sided interval may be recommended for general use if the sample size is 10 or more and the nominal confidence coefficient is 95\% or less, or if the sample size is 30 or more and the confidence coefficient is 99\% or less.

We show that this new uncertainty-adjusted investment skill metric (called Probabilistic Sharpe ratio, or PSR) has a number of important applications: First, it allows us to establish the track record length needed for rejecting the hypothesis that a measured Sharpe ratio is below a certain threshold with a given confidence level. Second, it models the trade-off between track record length and undesirable statistical features (e.g., negative skewness with positive excess kurtosis). Third, it explains why track records with those undesirable traits would benefit from reporting performance with the highest sampling frequency such that the IID assumption is not violated. Fourth, it permits the computation of what we call the Sharpe ratio Efficient Frontier (SEF), which lets us optimize a portfolio under non-Normal, leveraged returns while incorporating the uncertainty derived from track record length. Results can be validated using the Python code in the Appendix.}},

that something truly worrying is happening? It is intuitive that a drawdown
that lasts too long or one that is too deep should lead to a downward revision
of the assumed Sharpe ratio of the strategy. In this note, we give a
quantitative answer to this question based on the exact probability
distributions for the length and depth of the last drawdown for upward drifting
Brownian motions. We also point out that both managers and investors tend to
underestimate the length and depth of drawdowns consistent with the Sharpe
ratio of the underlying strategy.},

This article argues the opposite. With naive inputs, optimized portfolios usually outperform equally weighted portfolios. The ostensible superiority of the 1/N approach arises not from limitations in optimization but, rather, from reliance on rolling short-term samples for estimating expected returns. This approach often yields implausible expectations. By relying on longer-term samples for estimating expected returns or even naively contrived yet plausible assumptions, optimized portfolios outperform equally weighted portfolios out of sample.},

 abstract = {The expected market return is a number frequently required for the solution of many investment and corporate finance problems, but by comparison with other financial variables, there has been little research on estimating this expected return. Current practice for estimating the expected market return adds the historical average realized excess market returns to the Current observed interest rate. While this model explicitly reflects the dependence of the market return on the interest rate, it fails to account for the effect of changes in the level of market risk. Three models of equilibrium expected market returns which reflect this dependence are analyzed in this paper. Estimation procedures which incorporate the prior restriction that equilibrium expected excess returns on the market must be positive are derived and applied to return data for the period 1926- 1978. The principal conclusions from this exploratory investigation are: (1) in estimating models of the expected market return, the non-negativity restriction of the expected excess return should be explicitly included as part of the specification; (2) estimators which use realized returns should be adjusted for heteroscedasticity.},

	abstract={This thesis revisits the portfolio selection problem in cases where returns cannot be modeled as Gaussian. The emphasis is on the development of financially intuitive and statistically sound approaches to portfolio risk minimization. When returns exhibit asymmetry, we propose using a quantile-based measure of risk which we call shortfall. Shortfall is related to Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk, and can be tuned to capture tail risk. We formulate the sample shortfall minimization problem as a linear program. Using results from empirical process theory, we derive a central limit theorem for the shortfall portfolio estimator. We warn about the statistical pitfalls of portfolio selection based on the minimization of rare events, which happens to be the case when shortfall is tuned to focus on extreme tail risk. In the presence of heavy tails and tail dependence, we show that portfolios based on the minimization of alternative robust measures of risk may in fact have lower variance than those based on the minimization of sample variance. We show that minimizing the sample mean absolute deviation yields portfolios that are asymptotically more efficient than those based on the minimization of the sample variance, when returns have a multivariate Student-t distribution with degrees of freedom less than or equal to 6. This motivates our consideration of other robust measures of risk, for which we present linear and quadratic programming formulations.(cont.) We carry out experiments on simulated and historical data, illustrating the fact that the efficiency gained by considering robust measures of risk may be substantial. Finally, when the number of return observations is of the same order of magnitude as, or smaller than, the dimension of the portfolio being estimated, we investigate the applicability of regularization to sample risk minimization. We examine both L1- and L2-regularization. We interpret regularization from a Bayesian perspective, and provide an algorithm for choosing the regularization parameter. We validate the use of regularization in portfolio selection on simulated and historical data, and conclude that regularization can yield portfolios with smaller risk, and in particular smaller variance.},

These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},

We subject the paper to thoroughgoing scrutiny, including an attempt to replicate the findings in-sample. Using the authors’ subsampling technique, we replicate their sample window (less the since-deleted and hence unavailable tweets) and extend it backwards to include 2007. Constructing multiple measures of Twitter mood using word-count methods and standard sentiment analysis tools, we are unable to reproduce the p-value pattern that they found. We find evidence of a statistically significant Twitter mood effect in their subsample, but not in the backwards extended sample, a result consistent with data snooping. We find no evidence that our measures of Twitter mood aid in predicting the stock market out of sample. Congruously, the hedge fund set up in late 2010 to implement the Twitter mood strategy, Derwent Capital Markets, failed and closed in early 2012.},

The basic assumption is that there is available a random sample from a normal distribution with mean and variance unknown. Some of the mathematical properties of the noncentral t-distribution are also outlined. An extensive bibliography has been prepared and cross-referenced to several review journals and books. The bibliography covers references to tolerance limits and sampling plans based on the normal distribution whether or not the noncentral t-distribution is directly involved.

return distributions to evaluation of analytical functions of the moments. This
allows an analysis of the risk properties of systems to be carefully attributed
between choices of risk function (e.g. VaR vs CVaR); choice of return
distribution (power law tail vs Gaussian) and choice of event frequency, for
risk assessment. We exploit this to provide a simple method for portfolio
optimization when the asset returns follow a standard multivariate T
distribution. This may be used as a semi-analytical verification tool for more
general optimizers, and for practical assessment of the impact of fat tails on
asset allocation for shorter time horizons.},

	abstract = {The problem of constructing a confidence interval for the noncentrality parameter of a noncentral t-distribution based upon one observation from the distribution is an interesting problem with important applications. A general theoretical approach to the problem is provided by the specification and inversion of acceptance sets for each possible value of the noncentrality parameter. The standard method is based upon the arbitrary assignment of equal tail probabilities to the acceptance set, while the choices of the shortest possible acceptance sets and UMP unbiased acceptance sets provide even worse confidence intervals, which means that since the standard confidence intervals are uniformly shorter than those of UMPU method, the standard method are “biased”. However, with the correct choice of acceptance sets it is possible to provide an improvement in terms of confidence interval length over the confidence intervals provided by the standard method for all values of observation.  The problem of testing the equality of the noncentrality parameters of two non- central t-distributions is considered, which naturally arises from the comparison of two signal-to-noise ratios for simple linear regression models. A test procedure is derived that is guaranteed to maintain type I error while having only minimal amounts of conservativeness, and comparisons are made with several other approaches to this problem based on variance stabilizing transformations. In summary, these simulations confirm that the new procedure has type I error probabilities that are guaranteed not to exceed the nominal level, and they demonstrate that the new procedure has size and power levels that compare well with the procedures based on variance stabilizing transformations.},

	abstract = {In frequentist inference, we commonly use a single point (point estimator) or an interval (confidence interval/“interval estimator”) to estimate a parameter of interest. A very simple question is: Can we also use a distribution function (“distribution estimator”) to estimate a parameter of interest in frequentist inference in the style of a Bayesian posterior? The answer is affirmative, and confidence distribution is a natural choice of such a “distribution estimator”. The concept of a confidence distribution has a long history, and its interpretation has long been fused with fiducial inference. Historically, it has been misconstrued as a fiducial concept, and has not been fully developed in the frequentist framework. In recent years, confidence distribution has attracted a surge of renewed attention, and several developments have highlighted its promising potential as an effective inferential tool.

This article reviews recent developments of confidence distributions, along with a modern definition and interpretation of the concept. It includes distributional inference based on confidence distributions and its extensions, optimality issues and their applications. Based on the new developments, the concept of a confidence distribution subsumes and unifies a wide range of examples, from regular parametric (fiducial distribution) examples to bootstrap distributions, significance (p-value) functions, normalized likelihood functions, and, in some cases, Bayesian priors and posteriors. The discussion is entirely within the school of frequentist inference, with emphasis on applications providing useful statistical inference tools for problems where frequentist methods with good properties were previously unavailable or could not be easily obtained. Although it also draws attention to some of the differences and similarities among frequentist, fiducial and Bayesian approaches, the review is not intended to re-open the philosophical debate that has lasted more than two hundred years. On the contrary, it is hoped that the article will help bridge the gaps between these different statistical procedures.}

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to present a theoretically sound portfolio performance measure that takes into account higher moments of the distribution of returns. First, we perform a study of the investor's preferences to higher moments of   distribution within expected utility theory and discuss the performance measurement. To illustrate the investor's preferences to higher moments and the computation of a performance measure, we provide an approximation analysis of the optimal capital allocation problem and derive a formula for the Sharpe ratio adjusted for skewness of distribution. This performance measure justifies the notion of the Generalized Sharpe Ratio (GSR) introduced by Hodges (1998) which presumably accounts for all moments of distribution. We present two methods of practical estimation of the GSR: nonparametric and parametric. For the implementation of the parametric method we derive a closed-form solution for the GSR where the higher moments are calibrated to the normal inverse Gaussian distribution. We illustrate how the GSR can mitigate the shortcomings of the Sharpe ratio in resolution of Sharpe ratio paradoxes and reveal the real performance of portfolios with manipulated Sharpe ratios. We also demonstrate the use of this measure in the performance evaluation of hedge funds.},

 abstract = {While the Sharpe ratio is still the dominant measure for ranking risky assets, a substantial effort has been made over the past three decades to find a way to account for non-Normally distributed risks. This paper derives a generalized ranking measure which, under a regularity condition, correctly ranks risks relative to the original investor problem for a broad probability space. Moreover, like the Sharpe ratio, the generalized measure maintains wealth separation for the broad HARA utility class. Besides being effective in the presence of "fat tails," the generalized measure is also a foundation for multi-asset class portfolio optimization due to its ability to pairwise rank two risks following two different probability distributions. This paper also explores the theoretical foundations of risk ranking, including proving a key impossibility theorem: any ranking measure that is valid for non-Normal distributions cannot generically be free from investor preferences. Finally, this paper shows that the generalized ratio provides substantially more ranking power than simpler approximation measures that have sometimes been used in the past to account for non-Normal higher moments, even if those approximations are extended to include an infinite number of higher moments.},

In contrast to previous works, the constrained CRB presented does not require that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) for the unconstrained problem be of full rank. This is a useful extension because, for several signal processing problems (such as blind channel identification), the unconstrained problem is unidentifiable. Our expression for the constrained CRB depends only on the unconstrained FIM and a basis of the nullspace of the constraint's gradient matrix. We show that our constrained CRB formula reduces to the known expression when the FIM for the unconstrained problem is nonsingular. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the constrained CRB is also derived.},

@article{plyakha2014equal,
  abstract = {Does the choice of weighting scheme used to form test portfolios influence inferences drawn from empirical tests of asset pricing? To answer this question we first show that, with monthly rebalancing, an equal-weighted portfolio outperforms a value-weighted portfolio in terms of total mean return, four-factor alpha, and Sharpe ratio. We then explain that this outperformance is partly because the equal-weighted portfolio has higher exposure to systematic risk factors; but, a considerable part (42%) of the outperformance comes from the difference in alphas, which is a consequence of the rebalancing to maintain constant weights in the equal-weighted portfolio. Finally, we demonstrate that the inferences drawn from tests of asset-pricing models are substantially different depending on whether one uses equal- or value-weighted test portfolios. We illustrate this by considering four applications: (1) a test of the CAPM, using the methodology of Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (1989); (2) a test of the spanning properties of the stochastic discount factor, using the approach of Hansen and Jagannathan (1991); (3) a test of the relation between characteristics and returns, using the multivariate weighted two-stage procedure of Fama and MacBeth (1973); and (4) a test of whether expected idiosyncratic volatility is priced or not, using the non-parametric methodology of Patton and Timmermann (2010). For all four tests, we explain how the weighting scheme influences our inferences.},

In offering a more flexible prior distribution for the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution it has general applicability. It also offers a conjugate Bayesian analysis for problems of missing data where the missing data has a monotone structure. It has been especially useful in simultaneous modeling of the spatial distribution of ozone where monitoring stations come on-stream in sequence, using multivariate regression analysis for interpolation and prediction.},

The problem is not straightforward because the parameter space has a finite end-point at λ2 = 0: λ2 is not allowed to be negative, yet λ2 = 0 is feasible. Practical applications include asymptotic interval estimates for multiple correlation coefficients. Bayesian intervals are also discussed. Our overall recommendation is for the use of a ‘symmetric range’ confidence interval. "

@article{generalizedgamma,
  abstract = {This paper concerns a generalization of the gamma distribution, the specific form being suggested by Liouville's extension to Dirichlet's integral formula [3]. In this form it also may be regarded as a special case of a function introduced by L. Amoroso [1] and R. d'Addario [2] in analyzing the distribution of economic income. (Also listed in [4] and [5].) In essence, the generalization (1) herein is accomplished by supplying a positive parameter, p, as an exponent in the exponential factor of the gamma distribution. The moment generating function is shown, and cumulative probabilities are related directly to the incomplete gamma function (tabulated in [6]). Distributions are given for various functions of independent "generalized gamma variates" thus defined, special attention being given to the sum of such variates. Convolution results occur in alternating series form, with coefficients whose evaluation may be tedious and lengthy. An upper bound is provided for the modulus of each term, and simplified computation methods are developed for some special cases. A corollary is derived showing that the researches of Robbins in [7] apply to a larger class of problems than was treated in [7]. Extensions of his methods lead to iterative formulae for the coefficients in series obtained for an even larger class of problems.},

  abstract = {It is now well known that the Sharpe ratio and other related reward-to-risk measures may be manipulated with option-like strategies. In this paper we derive the general conditions for achieving the maximum expected Sharpe ratio. We derive static rules for achieving the maximum Sharpe ratio with two or more options, as well as a continuum of derivative contracts. The optimal strategy rules for increasing the Sharpe ratio. Our results have implications for performance measurement in any setting in which managers may use derivative contracts. In a performance measurement setting, we suggest that the distribution of high Sharpe ratio managers should be compared with that of the optimal Sharpe ratio strategy. This has particular application in the hedge fund industry where use of derivatives is unconstrained and manager compensation itself induces a non-linear payoff. The shape of the optimal Sharpe ratio leads to further conjectures. Expected returns being held constant, high Sharpe ratio strategies are, by definition, strategies that generate regular modest profits punctunated by occasional crashes. Our evidence suggests that the 'peso problem' may be ubiquitous in any investment management industry that rewards high Sharpe ratio managers.},

The paper posits a stochastic variance model of VIX time evolution, and develops an expression for VIX futures. Free parameters are estimated from market data over the past few years. It is found that the model with parameters estimated from the whole period from 1990 to 2005 overprices the futures contracts by 16-44%. But the discrepancy is dramatically reduced to 2-12% if the parameters are estimated from the most recent one-year period.},

	title = {An empirical analysis of quantitative trading strategies},
	abstract={Along with the increasing computing power, growing availability of various data streams, introduction of the electronic exchanges, decreasing trading costs and heating-up competition in financial investment industry, quantitative trading strategies or quantitative trading rules have been evolving rapidly in a few decades. They challenge the Efficient Market Hypothesis by trying to forecast future price movements of risky assets from the historical market information in algorithmic ways or in statistical ways. They try to find some patters or trends from the historical data and use them to beat the market benchmark. In this research, I introduce several quantitative trading strategies and investigate their performances empirically i.e. by executing back-tests assuming that the S&P 500 stock index is a risky asset to trade. The strategies utilize the historical data of the stock index itself, trading volume movement, risk-free rate movement and implied volatility movement in order to generate buy or sell trading signals. Then I attempt to articulate and decompose the source for successes of some strategies in the back-tests into several factors such as trend patterns or relationships between market information variables in intuitive way. Some strategies recorded higher performances than the benchmark in the back-tests, however it is still a problem how we can distinguish these winner strategies beforehand from the losers at the beginning of our investment horizon. Human discretion such as macro view on the future market trend is considered to still play an important role for quantitative trading to be successful in the long-run.},

These findings can partially explain the tendency of long-horizon regressions to find “significant” results where previous short-term approaches find none.

  abstract = {Predictive stock return regressions have two distinctive characteristics: i) the predictor on the right-hand side is persistent and its variance is orders of magnitude smaller than the variance of returns; (ii) the left-hand side variable is a long-horizon return constructed from overlapping sums of short-horizon returns. We offer a new model for the predictor that parsimoniously captures and links its persistence and small variance. We then use two asymptotic approaches to analyze the properties of long-horizon regressions. The approaches differ in their treatment of the overlap. One of the asymptotics has previously been analyzed with other data generating processes, while the second one is novel. We find that under both asymptotics, least-squares estimators are not consistent, their t-statistics diverge, and the R is not an adequate goodness-of-fit measure. Interestingly, a re-scaled version of the t-statistic is consistent under both long-horizon approximations and is suitable for testing predictability in long-horizon regressions. A Monte Carlo analysis of the finite-sample properties of the re-scaled t-statistic reveals that both approximations are accurate even for small sample sizes. We apply these results to test for predictability in returns of real estate investment trusts (REITs) which have come into existence only since the early 1970s and for which a reliable predictability test is crucial given the small dataset.},

results in a more diversified and less skewed portfolio (compared with
optimizing the Sharpe ratio). We give an explicit algorithm for such
optimization. We also discuss (Fano-ratio-inspired) long-short strategies that
outperform those based on optimizing the Sharpe ratio in our backtests.},

  abstract = {While the noncentral Wishart distribution is generally introduced as the distribution of the random symmetric matrix Y1∗Y1+⋯+Yn∗Yn where Y1,…,Yn are independent Gaussian rows in Rk with the same covariance, the present paper starts from a slightly more general definition, following the extension of the chi-square distribution to the gamma distribution. We denote by γ(p,a;σ) this general noncentral Wishart distribution: the real number p is called the shape parameter, the positive definite matrix σ of order k is called the shape parameter and the semi-positive definite matrix a of order k is such that the matrix ω=σaσ is called the noncentrality parameter. This paper considers three problems: the derivation of an explicit formula for the expectation of tr(Xh1)…tr(Xhm) when X∼γ(p,a,σ) and h1,…,hm are arbitrary symmetric matrices of order k, the estimation of the parameters (a,σ) by a method different from that of Alam and Mitra [K.

  abstract = {Dimension reduction methods are useful pre-processing tools for efficient quantitative analysis with the aim to preserve the main features of the multidimensional data. However, negative values resulting from the transformation may obscure the interpretation of the analysis. This novel study aims to investigate the effects of non-negative dimension reduction methods on the mean-variance portfolio optimization model. Backtesting results for major stock market indices show that reducing dimensionality of asset prices may improve the overall efficiency of the mean-variance portfolio optimization output.},

abstract = {Abstract We study bounds on the Value-at-Risk (VaR) of a portfolio when besides the marginal distributions of the components its variance is also known, a situation that is of considerable interest in risk management. We discuss when the bounds are sharp (attainable) and also point out a new connection between the study of VaR bounds and the convex ordering of aggregate risk. This connection leads to the construction of an algorithm, called Extended Rearrangement Algorithm (ERA), that makes it possible to approximate sharp VaR bounds. We test the stability and the quality of the algorithm in several numerical examples. We apply the results to the case of credit risk portfolio models and verify that adding the variance constraint gives rise to significantly tighter bounds in all situations of interest.}
